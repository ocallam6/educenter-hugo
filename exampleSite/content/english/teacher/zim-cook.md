### About Me

My name is Matthew O'Callaghan and I am currently a PhD researcher at Cambridge University. I began my undergraduate degree at Trinity College where I was awarded a Gold Medal for academic excellence. Following this I completed the Part III masters at Cambridge University (often considered to be the most difficult mathematics course in the world) and I achieved a Distinction for my masters thesis on differential geometry and mathematical physics.

I have been teaching mathematics and physics since 2015 at a very high level. My students tend to be ambitious and interested, with a keen willingness to work and understand the content to a high degree. Many of my students are in high school or university and the courses we cover range from university level mathematics to local exam preparation. My students proceed to fantastic universities, such as Oxbridge, Ivy League and other top universities in their respective countries. I aim to make very enjoyable classes which will shape my students into brilliant mathematicians and prepare them for a career in the field or to excel at examination.
